# For My Wife üíù

## Overview

My wife takes a long time before making any life decisions, whether it is to try on new diet or to get a new pair of shoes. Thorough research is a must and hasty impulsive purchases are not tolerated. I know she is not alone.

**For My Wife** is a multi-agentic research system designed to help my wife (or anyone else) gain multifaceted insights and make informed decisions on any topic. The app uses AI to generate comprehensive debates between AI researchers, providing balanced perspectives on any subject matter. This debate format is intended to deliver the researched insights in an engaging and memorable manner to people who enjoy watching dramas like my wife (I mean the users).

This project was created to save time on research when making decisions, offering a comprehensive understanding of topics through deep research, structured debates, visual illustrations, and audio presentations.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Research**: Analyzes topics and identifies diverse, opposing perspectives for deep research
- **Visual Debates**: Generates custom illustrations
- **Structured Essays**: Creates well-researched essays supporting each position
- **Interactive Podcasts**: Produces debate scripts with a moderator and two debaters.
- **Audio Generation**: Converts scripts to audio using different voices for each speaker
